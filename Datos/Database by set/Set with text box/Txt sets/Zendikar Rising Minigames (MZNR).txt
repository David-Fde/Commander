Base Race
Card
2 players | 3 packs | 10 minutes
OBJECTIVE:
Competition among treasure hunters on Zendikar is fierce. Find your opponent’s base camp before they find yours!
GET READY:
"Open three packs, give one basic land to each player, then remove any remaining land cards and any cards without Magic card backs. Shuffle the remaining cards together and deal 11 cards to each player."
Each player then looks at their cards and arranges them face down in a 4x3 grid opposite their opponent. The completed play area should be 4x6 with no extra spaces. The first player to finish their grid goes first.
LET’S PLAY:
"On their turn, each player moves one of their cards one space either vertically or horizontally—not diagonally, and not onto a space occupied by another card they own."
You can use your turn to move a card safely onto an

Card
empty space. Moving a card onto a space occupied by an opponent’s card starts a battle! Reveal both cards and do the following for each card type:
"If both revealed cards are Creatures/Artifact Creatures, the card with the higher toughness wins and remains face up; the loser is discarded. If they tie, the attacker wins."
"Legendary Creatures/Planeswalkers always win against nonlegendary creatures. When they battle each other, the higher toughness or loyalty wins. If they tie, the attacker wins."
"If either of the revealed cards is an Instant/Sorcery/Enchantment, discard both revealed cards. (Other effects still happen.)"
"If one of the revealed cards is an Artifact, the player who owns it discards it and takes an extra turn. If both revealed cards are Artifacts, only the attacker gets the extra turn."
TO WIN:
"When a Land is revealed in battle, its owner loses the game. When one Land attacks another, the attacking land wins the game."
Booster Blitz
Card
2 players | 2 packs | 10 minutes
OBJECTIVE:
Best your opponent in a series of fast Magic games using only the cards in a single pack!
GET READY:
Each player opens a pack and makes four face-down piles of three cards each using the Magic cards inside. Players make their piles with the goal of winning a series of Magic games with these modified rules:
"Players start at 5 life, have infinite mana, and cannot lose by drawing from an empty library."
LET’S PLAY:
"Randomly determine who goes first. Each player chooses which pile their opponent will use for each round. Then both players draw all three of their cards and play a game of Magic. When a player loses a game, they get to go first in the next game."
TO WIN:
The first player to win two games wins the match.
Booster Sleuth
Card
2 players | 2 packs | 10 minutes
OBJECTIVE:
"Unlike Jace, not all of us can rely on telepathy to solve a mystery. Using other cards as clues, discover all the facts about your opponent’s mystery card."
GET READY:
"Randomly determine who goes first—that player is the Secretkeeper, and their opponent is the Detective. First, the Secretkeeper opens a pack and removes any lands and cards without Magic card backs. Next, they shuffle the remaining cards and pick one at random. That card is the mystery card. Finally, the Secretkeeper gives the Detective the rest of the cards, and the game begins."
LET’S PLAY:
The Detective must correctly guess four facts
Booster Sleuth (cont'd)
Card
"about the mystery card: converted mana cost, color, card type, and the number of words in its name. To do this, they choose and reveal cards one at a time."
"When each card is revealed, the Secretkeeper tells the Detective how many of the four facts that card and the mystery card have in common. Then the Detective may either guess the four facts or reveal another card to get more clues."
"The Detective gets only one guess, and they must guess all four facts correctly to win. Once the Detective has guessed, the round ends and the players switch roles with a new pack."
TO WIN:
"Discover all four facts using as few cards as possible. The Detective who guesses correctly using the fewest clue cards wins! If neither player guessed correctly, or if there is a tie, play another round!"
Roil Royale
Card
2-6 players | 1 pack | 5 minutes
OBJECTIVE:
Ancient Kor ruins are being discovered across Zendikar! Be the first player to locate the ruins while avoiding the wrath of the Roil!
GET READY:
"Open a pack and remove any cards without Magic card backs, then place all the cards face down on the table and randomize them. Whoever went camping most recently goes first."
LET’S PLAY:
Players take turns revealing one of the cards on the table. Each card has unique properties that may help the player on their way to the ruins:
"Commons are campsites. Once revealed, they are discarded."
"Uncommons, rares, and mythics are guides."
Roil Royale (cont'd)
Card
"When a player reveals a guide, they keep that card."
"Foils are maps. When a player reveals a map, they keep that card. Players can use maps to peek at one of the cards on the table before choosing a card to reveal. The map is then put back onto the table face down, the cards are randomized, and play continues. (Foil uncommons, rares, and mythics can be used as either a map or a guide!)"
"The basic land is the location of the ruins. When a player reveals the land, if they have no guides, they are killed by the Roil and eliminated from the game. If that player has one guide, they survive. In either case, the ruins (and the guide) are put back onto the table face down, the cards are randomized, and play continues."
TO WIN:
The first player to collect two guides and find the ruins—or the last player standing—wins!
Strictly Better
Card
3-6 players | 3-6 packs | 15 minutes
OBJECTIVE:
"Some cards are strong in Standard, others shine in Draft, but which card looks the tastiest? Take turns being the Judge and decide which Magic card is the best of the best in each wacky category."
GET READY:
"Randomly determine who will be the first Judge. Each player then opens a pack, removes any cards without Magic backs, and looks at their cards."
LET’S PLAY:
The Judge chooses a category from the list on the back of this card (either their favorite or at random). The other players each secretly submit a card from their pack that they think fits the category.
"When the Judge has collected all the cards, they reveal each card, read it aloud, then choose the winner."
"The Judge role then passes to the next player, and they select a different category."
