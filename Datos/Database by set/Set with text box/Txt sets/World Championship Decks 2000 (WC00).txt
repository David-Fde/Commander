Janosch Kühn Bio (2000)
Card
"Hannover, Germany native Janosch Kühn joined an elite group of players in earning his second World Championship Top 8. Kühn played a red-green deck known as “Angry ‘Derm” or “Son of Hermit.” The deck built up its mana early with Birds of Paradise or Llanowar Elves, and then followed that up with mana-denial cards like Stone Rain, Plow Under, and Avalanche Riders. Masticore and Blastoderm provided the finishing punch."

Jon Finkel Bio
Card
"“World Champion” was the one honor Jon Finkel had yet to claim. His dominating performance at this year’s World Championships earned him that title at lost. Finkel played an explosive deck that is named after its most important card, Tinker. Fellow Team Antarctica member Dan O'Mahoney-Schwartz designed this monoblue deck. The deck used artifacts such as Grim Monolith, Metalworker, and Voltaic Key to quickly generate huge amounts of mana, and then used that mana to put large creatures into play."

Once those three cards were in play, Labarre could generate as much mana as he wanted. With unlimited mana, he could play a very big Blaze or use Whetstone to immediately deck his opponent."
