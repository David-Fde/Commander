Legendary Creature — Devil
"Whenever an opponent draws their first card each turn, if it’s not their turn, you create a 1/1 red Devil creature token with “When this creature dies, it deals 1 damage to any target.”"
"Whenever one or more Devils you control attack one or more players, you and those players each draw a card, then discard a card at random."
