A Display of My Dark Power
All in Good Time
All Shall Smolder in My Wake
Approach My Molten Realm
Behold the Power of Destruction
Choose Your Champion
"Dance, Pathetic Marionette"
Embrace My Diabolical Vision
Every Hope Shall Vanish
Every Last Vestige Shall Rot
Evil Comes to Fruition
Feed the Machine
I Bask in Your Silent Awe
I Call on the Ancient Magics
I Delight in Your Convulsions
Ignite the Cloneforge!
"I Know All, I See All"
Into the Earthen Maw
Introductions Are in Order
Know Naught but Fire
Look Skyward and Despair
May Civilization Collapse
Mortal Flesh Is Weak
My Crushing Masterstroke
My Genius Knows No Bounds
My Undead Horde Awakens
My Wish Is Your Command
Nature Demands an Offering
Nature Shields Its Own
Nothing Can Stop Me Now
Only Blood Ends Your Nightmares
Realms Befitting My Majesty
Roots of All Evil
"Rotted Ones, Lay Siege"
Surrender Your Thoughts
The Dead Shall Serve
The Fate of the Flammable
The Iron Guardian Stirs
The Pieces Are Coming Together
The Very Soil Shall Shake
"Tooth, Claw, and Tail"
Which of You Burns Brightest?
Your Fate Is Thrice Sealed
Your Puny Minds Cannot Fathom
Your Will Is Not Your Own
